## Set up development tooling

- npm init -y
- npm install --save-dev hardhat
- execute npx hardhat and create a basic sample project
  npx hardhat creates a contracts, scrips and test folders. And a hardhat-config.js file.
  packages that must be installed: npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers
- npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
  OpenZeppelin is another library that's used a lot to develop secure smart contracts.
